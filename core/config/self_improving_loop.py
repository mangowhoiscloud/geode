"""Outer-loop config — single SoT loader.

Reads ``~/.geode/config.toml`` ``[self_improving_loop.*]`` sections into a typed
pydantic v2 model. The loader is the SoT consumed by autoresearch /
seed-generation / petri_audit / geode_main wherever self-improving-loop runtime
decisions are made.

Why a separate module from :mod:`core.config`
=============================================

:class:`core.config._settings.Settings` carries the user-facing GEODE
runtime config (anthropic credential source, default model, etc.) and
is consumed by hundreds of call sites. Adding self-improving-loop fields there
would inflate every cold-start invocation that just wants a single
constant.

Outer-loop config is opt-in — only autoresearch / seed-generation /
petri callers load it, and the cost is paid lazily inside their
``run`` entrypoints. The two configs share the same file
(``~/.geode/config.toml``) but live in disjoint sections so they
never overwrite each other.

Precedence (Codex / OpenAI Agents pattern)
==========================================

1. ``~/.geode/config.toml`` ``[self_improving_loop.*]`` section — this
   loader. Per-role petri model selection lives under
   ``[self_improving_loop.petri.<role>]`` (PR-CSP-12, 2026-05-22 — the
   single SoT for ``auditor`` / ``target`` / ``judge`` after the
   duplicate-SoT consolidation removed argv defaults, the
   ``TARGET_MODEL`` / ``JUDGE_MODEL`` module constants, and the legacy
   ``~/.geode/petri.toml`` writer).
2. Picker defaults in ``core/self_improving/train.py`` (``BUDGET_MINUTES``,
   ``SEED_LIMIT``, etc.) — fallback when the section is missing. Role
   models fall back to the manifest ``default_model`` in
   ``plugins/petri_audit/petri.plugin.toml`` via
   ``core.self_improving.train._petri_role_model``.
3. Pydantic model default — last resort.

# enum (single SoT). Previously this module, ``MutatorConfig.source``,
# ``plugins.seed_generation.auth_coverage.Source`` and
# ``settings.{provider}_credential_source`` each spelled the source set
# differently (``api_key`` in some, not others; ``auto`` in some, not others) —
# they now all reference one enum, so a change can no longer silently diverge.
#
# PAYG: ``api_key`` is a valid member again. The
# ``project_payg_exclusion_decision`` intent — a subscription-only run must not
# *silently* fall through to PAYG — is preserved at resolution time
# (``plugins.petri_audit.credential_source.resolve_credential_source`` filters
# ``api_key`` out of ``auto`` expansion unless ``[self_improving_loop]
# fallback_to_payg=true``); an operator may still *explicitly* set
# ``source = "api_key"`` to opt in. The earlier type-level exclusion only caused
# the fragmentation above and blocked that explicit opt-in.
