"""PR-MINIMAL-4 — subprocess_failed journal event on non-zero exit.

Pre-PR ``core/self_improving/train.py:run_audit`` only emitted
``subprocess_finished`` (with ``exit_code`` in the payload). The
top-level ``audit_failed`` event at ``main()`` caught the resulting
``RuntimeError`` but lost subprocess-specific context (exit_code,
run_log path). PR-MINIMAL-4 inserts a dedicated
``subprocess_failed`` event before the ``raise RuntimeError`` so
downstream consumers grouping by event name can alert on it.
